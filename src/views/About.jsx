                <p>Those who know me, know Trash Puppy (TP) is a nickname for my dog Loki. Before he was adopted, he was a little trash puppy who was abandoned to fend for himself.</p>
                <p>Not unlike T.P., I am a young woman with a goal: to better myself and my life. After working as an ER nurse in a career full of destruction and heart break, I've decided instead to pursue inspiration, creativity, and vision.</p>
                <p>Every day I'm working hard to improve my skills as a programmer and cybersecurity professional.</p>
                <p>This website is an ever-expanding portfolio of my work and I encourage you to browse! While you're at it, think of Trash Puppy as a persona who motivates me to improve myself, my work, and my life.</p>
