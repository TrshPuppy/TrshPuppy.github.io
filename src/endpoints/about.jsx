                            Those who know me know Trash Puppy is a nickname for
                            my dog Loki. Before he was adopted, he was a little
                            trash puppy who was abandoned to fend for himself.

                            Not unlike T.P., I am a young woman with a goal: to
                            better myself and my life. After working as an ER
                            nurse in a career full of destruction and heart
                            break, I've decided instead to pursue inspiration,
                            creativity, and vision.

                        <p>
                            Every day I'm working hard to improve my skills as a
                            programmer and cybersecurity professional.
