# [Kioptrix](https://www.vulnhub.com/series/kioptrix,8/)

Kioptrix is a vulnerable VM you can download from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com). There are multiple [walkthroughs]() for attacking this box. The following are my notes from my own Kioptrix campaign:

## 1. [Scanning w/ nmap](/nested-repos/PNPT-study-guide/practical-ethical-hacking/scanning-enumeration/scanning-with-nmap.md)

```

### Findings (nmap):

#### Web Architecture:

From this scan we learn some things about the target's architecture:

1. The server supports OpenSSHv1 and we have some exposed host-keys (used to authenticate during an [SSH](/networking/protocols/SSH.md) connection)
2. Ports 80 and 443 ([HTTP](/networking/protocols/HTTP.md) & [HTTPS](/networking/protocols/HTTPS.md)) are running an Apache server, v1.3.20 as well as OpenSSL

**NOTE:** Any information about the software being used by the target, and the software's versions, is considered a finding because it can be used by an attacker to find exploits/ CVE's related to that software and its version.

##### Open[SSL](networking/protocols/SSL.md)

On port 443 (HTTPS) we can see OpenSSL is being used (and an old version) to authenticate and encrypt the target's web-data/ traffic.

#### Port & Service Mapping:

##### RPC:

Port 111 is running [RPC](/networking/protocols/RPC.md) (Remote Procedure Call). `nmap` also tells us that the _program numbers_ of the programs using the RPC protocol, as well as the ports they're on.

We can use this to probe those ports and see what type of information we get back. For example, using the [rpcinfo](/CLI-tools/linux/rpcbind-rpcinfo.md) command w/ the port `32768` we can get slightly more info back:

```bash
rpcinfo -s -n 32768 10.0.3.5
   program version(s) netid(s)                         service     owner
    100000  2         udp,tcp                          portmapper  unknown
    100024  1         tcp,udp                          status      unknown
```

### Nikto findings:

**NOTE:** Some targets w/ good security/ firewalls will block nikto.

#### Outdated software/ services:

Anything that returns as 'outdated' w/ Nikto can be reported as a finding. The more behind the version in use is to the current released version _the more serious the finding is_.

#### Directory Enumeration:

Nikto shows that there are some possible subdirectories we can enumerate on ports 80 and 443. To check for these, we can run a handful of tools:

##### [Feroxbuster](/cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/feroxbuster.md)

Feroxbuster is a tool similar to [gobuster](/cybersecurity/tools/scanning-enumeration/gobuster.md) except it's able to _do recursive enumeration_. We can try feroxbuster against Kioptrix like this:

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://10.0.3.5
# or:
feroxbuster -u https://10.0.3.5
```

With Kioptrix, we can find a few more instances of _information disclosure_. For example the subdirectory `/manual/mod/mod_perl.html` is a default user's manual for for using perl on the server.

From this page we can see that _the Apache HTTP Server_ is version 1.3b5. Another subdirectory we find with feroxbuser is `manual/mod/mod_perl.html`. From this page we can flip through an entire SSL-related module. From here we learn that the server is likely using _Mod_SSL version 2.8.31_.

These information disclosures are nice, but there isn't much else of use reported by feroxbuster and nikto. In fact, some of the subdirectories identified by nikto are _redirects or no longer active_, and we can't do anything with them.
