# Binary Exploitation I: Understanding the Stack

In general, buffer overflows are a type of binary exploitation which _targets stack frames in [memory](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes/blob/main/computers/memory/memory.md) allocated to data structures being used by a program._ The goal is to overwrite and _overflow_ the stack frame in order to access memory not intended to be accessed by that frame.

## Vulnerability

Buffer overflows are possible when a program is able to write more data to the _buffer space_ of a data structure/ subroutine than was intended. Writing past the bounds of the buffer causes _corruption of adjacent data on the call stack_. This will often cause the program to crash.

Additionally, stack memory _contains all the return addresses_ for active function calls, so overflowing it _is more effective_ at derailing an application than overflowing heap memory.

## Working Through an Example

### Vulnerable Code

In order to understand the buffer overflow, we need to have code which will compile into a binary which is _vulnerable to buffer overflow_:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>

void overflow() {
	char option[0x2];
	char name[0x100];
	int MAGIC = 0xe4ff;

	while(1) {
	memset(name, 0x00, 0x100);
	puts("Hey, whats your name!?\n");
	read(STDIN_FILENO, name, 4096);

	puts("Welcome ");
	puts(name);

	puts("is this name correct? (y/n)?");
	read(STDIN_FILENO, option, 2);
	if(option[0] == 'y' && option[1] == '\n') {
		break;
		}
	}
}

int main() {
	overflow();
	return 0;
}
```

In this code, the user inputs their name which is saved in the `name` buffer. It then asks the user if the inputed name is correct, then returns.

We can [compile](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes/blob/main/coding/compilation.md) the code using `gcc` into a binary. Then, (in linux), we can use [gdb](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes/blob/main/coding/gdb.md) to see/ work w/ the binary and step through execution. (P.S. there are additional steps which are necessary that I've purposefully left out. Go check out [TsarSec's course](https://taggartinstitute.org/courses/an-oral-history-of-binary-exploitation-defenses), it's free at the time of writing this).

## GNU Debugger

To attach the binary to gdb, all we have to do is use the command `gdb ./vuln` (or whatever you named the binary). This brings us to the opening prompt. There are a lot of options here, but we can simply start by setting a breakpoint at `main()` and then using `run`:

```bash
┌──(hakcypuppy㉿kali)-[~/tsar]
└─$ gdb ./vuln_1                                            # <-------------

```

We can step through the execution by using `c` in the prompt (for continue). `gdb` will print the output from the binary as you go.

```bash
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Hey, whats your name!?

tiddies
Welcome
tiddies

is this name correct? (y/n)?
```

### Looking @ the memory

To see all the areas of memory our binary will be using we can use the `info proc mappings` command. This will show us where the program is stored in memory, where the [heap and stack](computers/memory/memory.md) are mapped to, where all the attached libraries are, etc:

```bash
(gdb) info proc mappings
process 244655
Mapped address spaces:
          Start Addr           End Addr       Size     Offset  Perms  objfile
            0x400000           0x401000     0x1000        0x0  r--p   /home/hakcypuppy/tsar/vuln_1
      0x7ffff7dca000     0x7ffff7df0000    0x26000        0x0  r--p   /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
      ...
      0x7ffff7f9f000     0x7ffff7fac000     0xd000        0x0  rw-p
      0x7ffff7fc3000     0x7ffff7fc5000     0x2000        0x0  rw-p
      0x7ffff7fc5000     0x7ffff7fc9000     0x4000        0x0  r--p   [vvar]
      0x7ffff7fc9000     0x7ffff7fcb000     0x2000        0x0  r-xp   [vdso]
      ...
      0x7ffffffde000     0x7ffffffff000    0x21000        0x0  rwxp   [stack]
--Type <RET> for more, q to quit, c to continue without paging--
```

This is an edited list w/ some mappings removed but you can see that the program maps itself to `0x400000`, the stack is mapped to `0x7ffffffde000` (this is where it starts, and the `libc.so.6` library is at `0x7ffff7dca000`).

## Planning our Exploit

Since we know the `name` variable in the `overflow()` function is vulnerable, that's gonna be our target. _Every function on the stack_ has a _saved instruction pointer_ (saved `rip`) which tells the CPU where to go after the function has returned.

If we look at the [assembly](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes/blob/main/coding/languages/assembly.md) output for `overflow()` we can get an idea of how the stack will look. To see this, we just use `disassemble overflow` in `gdb`:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

### `call`

Looking at this we can see a few places where the `call` instruction is used in reference to functions in our c code. `call` does exactly what it sounds like: it calls the named function so it can be executed.

In the disassembled code for `overflow()`, `memset()` is the first subroutine being called in the `overflow()` function. Before we dive into what happens when a function is called, let's remember some things about the stack itself:
<br>
<br>
![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-4.png)
<br>
<br>

### Stack Things to Remember:

> **NOTE:**
> These guidelines apply to stack memory in x86 architectures

1. The stack spans a number of memory addresses in the [RAM](computers/memory/RAM.md).
2. The stack _grows downward_, i.e. frames are added _starting at the highest memory address, towards lower addresses_.
3. The "top of the stack" refers to the _lowest address in the stack_.
4. The 'bottom of the stack' refers to the _highest address in the stack_.
5. The first frame added to the stack _is the last frame which will be executed_ by the [CPU](https://github.com/TrshPuppy/obsidian-notes/blob/main/computers/cpu.md) (first in, last out or 'F.I.L.O.').
6. When data is written to a frame on the stack (i.e. to a variable in the function belonging to that frame) _the data is written towards higher memory addresses_ (the opposite direction that frames are added)

Knowing these guidelines, let's work through the stack manipulation which happens when `main()` is called.

### Stack Manipulation for `main()`

![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-5.png)
<br>
<br>
This is the assembly code for `main()`. We can see that the first call instruction is for `overflow()`, but some things are happening before that which relate to the stack.

#### Function Prologue:

The first 2 lines in our assembly code for `main()` is the _Function Prologue_. This is a common sequence in assembly seen before functions are called.

In this sequence, the frame pointer stored in the `%rbp` register is _pushed to the stack_, then the stack pointer (saved in `%rsp` register) is copied into the `%rbp` register.

This sequence is important for flow control because when an _activation frame_ (a frame which represents a function in the code) is pushed onto the stack or popped off, there is no way to control for the size of the frame. In other words functions in code have varying frame sizes.

The CPU needs to know where to resume execution after a frame finishes, and since a frame can be of varying length, the address where the CPU needs to resume is not a fixed length from it's last position.
<br>
<br>
![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-6.png)
<br>
<br>
The stack pointer _should always be pointed at the top of the stack_ (or the address right after the end address of the last frame, in this case '5').

Before calling `overflow()` (and pushing its frame onto the stack), we need to push the current frame pointer (the address in the `%rbp` register), onto the stack. When that happens the stack will look something like this:
<br>
<br>
![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-7.png)
<br>
<br>
Now that we've added a frame, we need to change the frame pointer to where the stack pointer is currently pointing. So we copy what's in the `%rsp` register into the `%rbp` register:
<br>
<br>
![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-8.png)
<br>
<br>
Now the frame pointer and the stack pointer are pointing at the same place in memory. That's okay for now. We're going to call `overflow()`, push it onto the stack, and `overflow()` will take care of moving the stack pointer to its new position.

### Disassembling `overflow()`

Before we update our stack picture, we have to understand what the `call` function does. In general, it calls the function being referenced, but there are 2 important parts which make that up:

1. `call` pushes the return address onto the stack (the address immediately following its own address)
2. It changes `rip` (the instruction pointer which is pointing at the assembly instructions) to the address of the function being called. _This ensures that the next instruction to be read by the CPU is the first instruction in the function being called_ (which is `overflow()`.

So lets update our drawing so it more closely matches what's happening in our overflow code:
<br>
<br>
![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-9.png)
<br>
<br>
Compared to our last picture, I've updated the addresses (they will be slightly different on different computers). We now have an address saved in the `%rip` register (updated by the `call` instruction). And our stack and frame pointers are still pointing at the same address on the stack.

**TIP:** In order to get these values I put a breakpoint at `overflow` in gdb, then used the `info registers` command (`i r` works too) to see what was stored in all the registers:
<br>
<br>
![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-10.png)
<br>
<br>

### Updating `rsp`

We've finally made it to the overflow code! Now, can we finally update the stack pointer so its pointing where it should be? In fact, the frame pointer should probably be updated too.

Let's look at the first few instructions of `overflow()`:

```asm
(gdb) disassemble overflow
Dump of assembler code for function overflow:
   0x0000000000401146 <+0>:     push   %rbp
   0x0000000000401147 <+1>:     mov    %rsp,%rbp
=> 0x000000000040114a <+4>:     sub    $0x110,%rsp
...
```

The first three instructions look super familiar. That's because the same sequence that we saw earlier w/ the frame and stack pointers is happening again; the _Function Prologue_. The last step of the function prologue (`sub $0x110,%rsp`) is _making room for the variables in the function being called_ by _subtracting_ from the stack pointer.

The `sub` command stands for `subtract`, so this command is _subtracting `0x110` from the stack pointer_. Since this is in hex, `0x110` is 272 (256 + 16), and we're subtracting 272 from the value currently held in the `%rsp` register.

_Since the stack grows downward, subtracting from the stack pointer will move it down towards the top of the stack._ So the new address should be `7FFF FFFF DCC0` for stack pointer. We can now update our picture:

<br>
<br>
![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-11.png)
<br>
<br>
After this, a few more instructions are executed. For now, suffice it to say that the variables local to `overflow()` are created, allocated space, etc.. They all exist inside the frame for `overflow()` on the stack and we can expand the `overflow` frame to show that:
<br>
<br>
![](/md-images/buffer-overflow-12.png)
<br>
<br>
And our stack now looks like this:
