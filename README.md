# TrshPuppy.io

## LIVE PREVIEW HERE: https://trshpuppy.github.io

This is the new and improv(ing) TrshPuppy.io! All of the same retro-pixelart vibes you love, served now statically (thanks Vite)!

## New Content?

Yes! My webdev days, though foundational, are over and I have more interesting projects in the works! Think Hacking & Cybersecurity!

## Goals:

-  Keep it simple, static files rule!
-  Host `.md` files parsed into `.html` (ooh!)
-  Hacking walkthroughs and tutorials

## This is a work in progress as always!

Come enjoy the journey over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/trshpuppy)
