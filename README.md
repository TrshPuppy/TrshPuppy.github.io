# TrshPuppy.github.io

## LIVE PREVIEW HERE: https://trshpuppy.github.io

This is a live preview of the webpage I've made for an Odin Project project (see here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

The included files/directories are copied over from the original repository which you can see here: https://github.com/TrshPuppy/odin-landing-page.

All of the included files/directories including pixelart and photos are my own and belong to me (other than the one github logo ;D).

I hope for this to eventually become an actual webpage for personal and professional use, but for now, I hope you enjoy!

P.S. please respect the work I've put into this and the included pixelart. If you want to copy/paste/use anything please ask <3.
