# TrshPuppy.io

## LIVE PREVIEW HERE: https://trshpuppy.github.io

This is the new and improv(ing) TrshPuppy.io! All of the same retro-pixelart vibes you love, served now using dynamic Golang HTML manipulation!

## New Content?
Yes! My webdev days, though foundational, are over and I have more interesting projects in the works! Think Hacking & Cybersecurity!

## Goals:
- Keep it simple, static files rule!
- Use Golang & templating (because I can!)
- Host `.md` files parsed into `.html` (ooh!)
- Hacking walkthroughs and tutorials

## This is a work in progress as always!
Come enjoy the journey over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/trshpuppy)

### P.S.
All of the pixelart assets are made by me, including the background! Please respect the hours I put into making them and I hope you enjoy!
