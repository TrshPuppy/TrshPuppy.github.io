# admin-dashboard

### This is my dashboard project for the Odin Project (theodinproject.com).
You can see the details of the project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard.

The requirements for this project include creating an admin dashboard using CSS and HTML with an emphasis on using intermediate skills, especially CSS grid.

This project allowed me to practice my front-end skills to create an attractive and responsive dashboard. I hope you enjoy!

Time spent: 14 hours.
