# etch-a-sketch

**This is my etch-a-sketch project for the Odin Project (theodinproject.com)**
You can see the details of the project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

The requirements of this project is to create an etch-a-sketch with a UI using CSS, HTML, and Javascript w/ an emphasis on DOM manipulation. Once completed, I plan to include it in my live portfolio here: https://trshpuppy.github.io.

As always, I hope you enjoy!
